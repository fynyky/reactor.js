# Reactor is a javascript framework for functional reactive programming
# It comprises of 2 primary components: Signals, and Observers
# 
# Signals represent values which can be observed
# Signals can depend on other signals
# When a signal is updated, it automatically updates all dependent signals as well
# 
# Observers represent reactions to changes in signals
# Observers are triggered after its dependent signals are updated
# 
# Observer and signal dependencies are set automatically 
# based on the observer/signal definition
# 
# When a signal is updated, it first updates all dependent signals
# After all dependnt signals have been updated, the relevant observers are notified
# From the perspective of observers, all signals are updated atomically and instantly 
# 
# TODOs
# events
# multi commit batching
# avoid removing array and setter methods if user overrides them

# global switcher depending on whether its node.js or in browser
global = exports ? this

# global stack to automatically track signal dependencies
# whenever a signal is evaluated - it puts itself on the dependency stack
# when other signals read their own value - they check dependency stack to see who is asking
# the top of the stack gets added as a dependent to the signal being read
# when a signals evaluation is done - it pops itself off the stack
dependencyStack = []

# Signals are functions representing observed values
# They are read by executing the function with no arguments
# They are set by executing the function with a signal definition as the only argument
# If the definition is a function - it is executed to retrive the signal value
# otherwise the definition is read as the value directly
# If a signal definition reads other signals, it automatically gets set as a dependent
# If any signal dependencies get updated, the signal is automatically updated as well
# Note that signal definition should NOT have any external effects
# They should only read values and not have any impact
# For external impacts - use observers
# to "destory" a signal - just pass set its value to null
global.Signal = (definition)->

  # stored value of this signal
  # only recalculated when definition has changed
  # or when a dependency notifies it to
  value = null

  # evaluate is a function to calculates the signal value given the definition
  # it recursively revaluates any signals that depend on it as well
  # Simultaneously, in order to know what observers to notify later
  # it recursively passes through a list to collect all the observers of the updated signals
  # After the signal cascade has completed, the observers on the list are notified
  evaluate = (observerList)->

    # by default the value is the definition
    value = definition
